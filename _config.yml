          ## **Responsibilities**
          
          #### Algorithm research and implementation: 
          Investigate the latest advances in relevant fields using PyTorch or Tensorflow deep learning frameworks. Analyze, process, and create
          data pipelines. Examples include:
            - Point cloud Segmentation. Conversion of point cloud LiDAR coordinate system to corresponding camera coordinate system (using celebrated camera’s).
            - Generative adversarial networks (GANs) for manipulation of image features (using non facial objects). Creation of custom dataset using Selenium based web scrappers. Created a web application that allowed users to interact with image features.
            - Instance and Semantic Segmentation of X-band radar images for object detection and object tracking.
            - Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms for sentence/word vectorization. Use sentence embeddings as a way of comparing sentence similarity.
          
          #### Deployment and Maintenance
          Deploy models into production using several web technologies such as AWS and GCP. Deployment done using REST API with web frameworks such as Celery/Flask, Django, and AWS with Docker. Debug, maintain, and update any issues that may arise with regards to the back-end

           ## **Satellite Segmentation Research and Implementation**: 
           Research and implementation of several deep learning based methods for segmentation using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
           The role also included: 
          
             - Creation of custom satellite dataset was created using OpenStreetMap and Pythons LabelMe.
             - Implementation of baseline segmentation algorithms, such as K-Means, and Suport Vector Machines
             - Research and application of Fully Connected Networks (FCN's) for segmentation. Done with Tensorflow (Keras).
          
           ## **Hyperspectral Image Analysis**: 
              Given hyperspectral image data, I was tasked with finding the contents of chloraphyll inside a river. This was done by researching algorithms that identified chlorapyll based on the reflectivity of water, and then taking samples from the river in question.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
